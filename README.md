# Challenge Statement

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. ​

With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy. ​

Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features. 
Build a REST API using ExpressJS to manage the movie details. The Node application should be able to read the data from a .json file as a REST resource.​

​Add new a movie, fetch all the movies, fetch a specific movie by id, delete a movie and update the details of a specific movie. ​

​Note: The REST resource can be hosted on the ​local machine on a specific port,​use the package json-server ​
to perform the same.
